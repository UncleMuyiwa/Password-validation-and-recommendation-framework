                <p>This is an artefact designed in partial fulfilment of my Msc program, The aim of the project is to
                    create a project that promotes better password practices among users and to address the weaknesses
                    associated with traditional passwords. </p>
                <p>To solidify the security of user accounts by making sure that passwords are difficult to guess
                    (resistant to brute force attacks),to reduce vulnerabilities associated with weak passwords,
                    guessable patterns and reuse of passwords and toimplement real-time feedback delivery that provides
                    guidelines to help users make good decisions</p>

                    <h3>what it does</h3>
                    <p>Password Validators are responsible for determining whether a proposed password is acceptable for
                        use
                        and could include checks like ensuring it meets minimum length requirements, that it has an
                        appropriate range of characters, or that it is not in the history.</p>
